The chrome extension that allows your dungeon master to spend more time being a storyteller and less time being a computer


##Installation
First, you need to clone or fork the repo. Then, read [https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked](these) instructions on installing unpacked chrome extensions.

###Changes
If you make changes to the code, you need to reload the extension in the chrome extension tab before the changes will be visible.

##Contributing
We're a very small team just doing this for fun, and as such don't have much of an official process for contributing. If you'd like to help out, just fork the repository and make some changes/bug fixes. Send us a pull request and we'd be delighted to work with you to incorporate your work.
